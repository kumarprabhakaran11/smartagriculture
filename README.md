# SMART AGRICULTURE
TEAM NAME : AGROCKET

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
            India is an Agriculture based country, India's Economy is greatly contributed by agricultural sectors.But in recent days, the farm lands and number of farmers decreased tremendously.If we search for the root of this act ,we can find that several decision making factors are the reason behind it.These problems can be easily and effectively overcomed by MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS.In our project we have created an Algorithm which severs like a fortune teller for the farmers by predicting the nutrition in soil and suggesting the crop can be planted based on the yield obtained.
            
FUTURE PLANS
             but in real time scenario farmers need assitance mainly in maintaining crops.Maintaining crops is a tedious work which require more human power but if we employ Artificial intelligence and Machine learning algorithms , we not only save time of farmer but also use the resources in effective manner this will definitely produce more profit to this farmer,which ultimately leads to increasing in farming lands.specificaly speaking, we would like to develop a CNN based Machine learning algorithm which identifies the disease in the crop and uses atomizer to spray pesticides and insecticides over the specific area and mainly to avoid the contact of pesticides over unaffected leaves.At the same,we are currently working to design a sensor which provides live time data to the Machine learning algorithm which greatly reduces the chances of risks and greatly increases the accuracy of prediction.
             
             IF THIS MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM BECOMES AVAILABLE TO EVERY FARMER.IT SIMPLY REDUCES HIS WORKS AND INCREASES PROFIT
             WHICH ULTIMATELY LEAD TO RECOVERY OF FARM LANDS AND FARMERS.
